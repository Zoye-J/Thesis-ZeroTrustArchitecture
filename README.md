# Zero Trust Architecture for Government Document Classification System

## Thesis Project - [BRAC university]

###  Overview
A research prototype implementing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles for secure document management systems. This academic project demonstrates identity-centric security, automated policy enforcement, and real-time monitoring as a proof-of-concept for modern security frameworks.

**Note:** This is a research prototype developed for academic purposes. It is not intended for production deployment without significant security review and hardening.

###  Core Security Features

#### Authentication & Identity Management
- JWT-based user authentication with role-based claims
- Multi-factor authentication simulation (password + context validation)
- Automated certificate management with browser-side key generation
- Department-based user classification and access isolation
- Clearance hierarchy implementation (BASIC → CONFIDENTIAL → SECRET → TOP_SECRET)

#### Policy-Based Authorization
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) integration for policy-as-code
- Context-aware access control with time and location factors
- Department isolation with progressive disclosure
- Real-time policy evaluation for every resource request
- Complete audit trail with decision rationale

#### Encryption & Data Protection
- End-to-end RSA encryption via dedicated OPA Agent
- Browser-based cryptography using Web Crypto API
- Client-side key storage in IndexedDB (private keys never leave browser)
- Hybrid encryption model for different payload sizes
- Automated certificate lifecycle management

#### Monitoring & Audit Capabilities
- Real-time event streaming via Redis pub/sub
- WebSocket-based live dashboard for security monitoring
- Complete request traceability across all services
- Security event classification and real-time alerts
- Multi-server health monitoring interface

###  System Architecture

The prototype implements a five-layer microservices architecture:

1. **Transport Layer**: HTTPS/TLSv1.2 for all communications
2. **Authentication Layer**: Gateway server handling JWT + mTLS validation
3. **Authorization Layer**: OPA Server for policy evaluation + OPA Agent for encryption
4. **Data Layer**: API server with business logic and database operations
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time dashboard with event streaming

**Architecture Note**: This layered approach demonstrates separation of concerns principle in security system design.

###  Research Objectives Demonstrated

1. **Identity-Centric Security**: Shifting from network perimeter to identity-based access control
2. **Automated Policy Management**: Dynamic policy evaluation based on real-time context
3. **Minimal User Friction**: Automated certificate management reduces authentication burden
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Complete visibility into security decisions and events
5. **Scalable Design**: Microservices architecture for potential horizontal scaling

###  Important Disclaimer

**Academic Research Prototype Only**
- This system is designed for research and demonstration purposes
- Security implementations should be reviewed by security professionals before any adaptation
- The prototype includes simplifications for demonstration clarity
- Not all edge cases or production scenarios are covered
- Cryptographic implementations are for research purposes only

###  Academic Context

This prototype was developed as part of a Master's thesis research into:
- Practical implementation challenges of Zero Trust Architecture
- Balance between security strength and user experience
- Automated policy management in dynamic environments
- Real-time monitoring requirements for continuous verification

###  Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.13, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Security**: JWT, mTLS, OPA, RSA/AES cryptography
- **Database**: SQLite with proper indexing
- **Real-time**: Redis, WebSocket, Flask-SocketIO
- **Frontend**: HTML5, JavaScript (Web Crypto API), Bootstrap
- **Monitoring**: Custom dashboard with real-time event streaming

###  License

This research prototype is shared for academic discussion and research purposes. All implementations are for demonstration and should not be used in production systems without comprehensive security review.
